# You will receive three integer numbers.
# Write functions named:
# â€¢	sum_numbers() that returns the sum of the first two integers
# â€¢	subtract() that returns the difference between the returned result of the first function and the third integer

# Wrap the two functions in a function named add_and_subtract() which will receive the three numbers as parameters.

# Print the result of the subtract() function on the console.
