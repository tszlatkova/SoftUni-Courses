# SoftUni-Courses
Courses from my education @ [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/).

Here you can find my solutions of some problems in the [Judge](https://judge.softuni.org/) system, using Python :snake:.

Encoding in front of the problems:

- ${\color{yellow} E }$ - "exercise";
- ${\color{yellow} L }$ - "lecture/lab";
- ${\color{yellow} M }$ - "more exercise".
