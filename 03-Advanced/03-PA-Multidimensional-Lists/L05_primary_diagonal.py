# Write a program that finds the sum of all numbers in a matrix's primary diagonal (runs
# from top left to bottom right). On the first line, you will receive an integer N â€“ the
# size of a square matrix. The next N lines hold the values for each column - N numbers,
# separated by a single space.

n = int(input())
