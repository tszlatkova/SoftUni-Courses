# Write a program that evaluates a string expression. You will be given that string
# expression on the first line in the form of numbers and operators separated with a
# single space from each other. Your job is to take that string expression and calculate
# the result after evaluating it.
# To do that, you have to follow a simple rule. If, for example, we have this string
# "2 4 * 1 3 -", the first time we meet an operator (*), we should take all the numbers we
# have so far (2, 4), apply that operation to them, and save the result (8). The next time
# we meet an operator (-), we again take all the numbers we have (8, 1, 3) and apply the
# operator to them in that order (8 - 1 - 3 = 4). In the end, we print the result.
# All the numbers will always be integers, and the possible operators are "*", "+", "-",
# "/". It is important to keep the order of the numbers (especially for "/" and "-"
# because the order matters). When having a division, you should round the result to the
# lower integer.

# Input
# •	Single line: a string containing integers and operators

# Output
# •	Single number: the result after the evaluation

# Constraints
# •	When reaching an operator, it is sure that you will have a minimum of one number to
# evaluate
# •	The string will always end with an operator, so you get one number as a result
# •	Operators and numbers will always be valid
# •	There will be no case of division by zero
# •	There might be negative numbers in the string
