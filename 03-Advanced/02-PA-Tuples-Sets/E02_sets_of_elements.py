# Write a program that prints a set of elements. On the first line, you will receive two
# numbers - n and m, separated by a single space - representing the lengths of two
# separate sets. On the next n + m lines, you will receive n numbers, which are the
# numbers in the first set, and m numbers, which are in the second set. Find all the
# unique elements that appear in both and print them on separate lines (the order does
# not matter).

# For example:
# Set with length n = 4: {1, 3, 5, 7}
# Set with length m = 3: {3, 4, 5}
# Set that contains all the elements that repeat in both sets -> {3, 5}

n, m = [int(number) for number in input().split(' ')]
# n, m = map(int, input.split())

first_set = set()
second_set = set()

for _ in range(n):
    first_set.add(int(input()))

for _ in range(m):
    second_set.add(int(input()))

print(*first_set.intersection(second_set), sep='\n')
