# Your first task at your new job is to create a table of the stock in a bakery, and you really don't want to fail
# on your first day at work.

# You will receive a single line containing some food (keys) and quantities (values). They will be separated by a
# single space (the first element is the key, the second â€“ the value, and so on). Create a dictionary with all the
# keys and values and print it on the console.
