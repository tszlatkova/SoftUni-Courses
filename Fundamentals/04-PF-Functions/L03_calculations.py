# Create a function that receives three parameters, calculates a result depending on the given operator, and returns
# it. Print the result of the function. The input comes as three parameters â€“ an operator as a string and two integer
# numbers. The operator can be one of the following:  "multiply", "divide", "add", "subtract".
