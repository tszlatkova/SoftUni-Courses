# As a gladiator, Peter needs to repair his broken equipment when he loses a fight. His equipment consists of a helmet,
# a sword, a shield, and an armor.
# You will receive Peter's lost fights count.
# Every second lost game, his helmet is broken.
# Every third lost game, his sword is broken.
# When both his sword and helmet are broken in the same lost fight, his shield also breaks.
# Every second time his shield brakes, his armor also needs to be repaired.
# You will receive the price of each item in his equipment. Calculate his expenses for the year for renewing his
# equipment.
