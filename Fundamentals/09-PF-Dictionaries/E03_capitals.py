# Using a dictionary comprehension, write a program that receives country names on the first line, separated by
# comma and space ", ", and their corresponding capital cities on the second line (again separated by comma and
# space ", "). Print each country with their capital on a separate line in the following format:
# "{country} -> {capital}".

# â€¢	You could use the zip() method.
